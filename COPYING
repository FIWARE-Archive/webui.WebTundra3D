CONTRIBUTIONS

    This repository was originally developed by Adminotech Oy for the Meshmoon hosting platform.
    The code was open sourced at 03.04.2014 with the Tundra license to the realXtend
    WebTundra repository. Open sourcing was done to bring a web browser based SDK and client 
    to the core Tundra platform for everyone, and in hopes of that this code will be helpful
    to the open source realXtend ecosystem and its users.

    The repository from this point on has been developed further as open source for the common good by
    Adminotech Oy and other contributors.
